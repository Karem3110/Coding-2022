		<h2>HTML</h2>

			<h3>What is HTML?</h3>
			<p>HTML stands for <strong>Hypertex Markup Language</strong> and it is a computer language for creating most web pages and online applications. HTML describes the structure of a web page, and consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.</p>

				<p>The main parts of an element are the followings:</p>
					<ol class="a">
						<li>The opening tag</li>
						<li>The closing tag</li>
						<li>The content</li>
						<li>The element</li>

		<h2>CSS</h2>
			<h3>What is CSS?</h3>
			<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it is a language that describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work, because it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
			   <p>CSS controls the presentation of a webpage and this includes:</p>
			</p>
				<ul class="b">
					<li>Layout.</li>
					<li>Colour of text and backgrounds.</li>
					<li>Size of HTML elements.</li>
					<li>Fonts.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>CSS consists of selectors, properties and values.</p>

				<h4>Anatomy of an CSS ruleset</h4>

	<p>The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:</p>
		<ul class="c">
			<li><strong>Selector</strong>.-This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example,&lt;/p&gt; elements). To style a different element, change the selector.</li>
			<li><strong>Declaration</strong>.- This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.</li>
			<li><strong>Properties</strong>.- These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the &lt;/p&gt; elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.</li>
			<li><strong>Property value</strong>.- To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)</li>
		</ul>
